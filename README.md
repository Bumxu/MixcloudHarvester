> Mixcloud Harvester gives you direct access to the music available on mixcloud.com without leaving your navigation, only:  

> **Â¡Use Mixcloud as normal!**

> On stored songs you will see two links, one to a compressed m4a file and other to an original mp3 file, this last will not be always available.  
> On remote files you will see "Play for download with Harvester...", ok, play the song and a download link will appear.  
If the song was already playing only play another song and again, play the desired and the link will appear.

> Easy!

> **--- About low speed complaints ---**  
Mixcloud limits servers speed to a normal PLAYING speed, and this is the DOWNLOAD speed, no miracles.
With a download manager it can improve in some cases.
